# Weather-App

The series of projects focuses on developing my skills in the Front End and Back End area of Software/Web Development.

Weather App
Uses the Open Weather Map API. Entering the location and will provide real time data i.e. Temperature, Humidity and Wind Speed of the entered location.


Stuff to be added:
- Connect Google Maps API and use the latitude and longitude value entered to find the weather of a specific suburb/city/state etc.
- Let user favourite/save different locations in order for user to not search each location every second
